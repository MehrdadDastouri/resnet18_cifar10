# Image Classification with ResNet-18

This project demonstrates how to use the ResNet-18 architecture for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. ResNet-18 is a powerful and efficient deep learning model that uses residual connections to improve performance.

## Features
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10, a dataset containing 60,000 images across 10 classes.
- **Pre-trained Model**: ResNet-18, pre-trained on ImageNet.
- **Data Augmentation**: Random cropping and horizontal flipping for better generalization.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Tracks training/test losses and test accuracy over epochs.
- **Model Saving**: Saves the trained model for future use.
